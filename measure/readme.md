# Pointer states and basis ambiguity

# Two descriptions (collapse OR decoherence)

Decoherence theory do not explain the collapse on eigenstates of an operator (that we call the 'Measured' operator, even if we do not know how to write it).

Instead the theory shows that the density matrix ends up diagonal in a basis, called _pointer basis_ (that is unique because, salvo recombination of degenerate states of the System + Apparatus system, a matrix is diagonal only in the unique eigenstates basis).

So the state, at the end of the interaction processes, **is a PURELY CLASSICAL SUPERPOSITION** (that, if you think to it, is equivalent to say that it is a Pure state) **of the Pointer states**.
So the system **IS IN ONE** of the Pointer states and there is no need of postulating a collapse.

### How the two descriptions are related (why they are both _effective_?)
The pointer basis _can be seen as_ the basis of eigenstates of a _proper operator_ $P_A$ (actually i did not get If of a single operator or common basis of more operators, because I've always looked to 2-dimensional systems and apparatus).

So, after the interactions, the system **IS** in an eigenstate of $P_A$.
And so, this Operator $P_A$ can be recognized as the **measured operator** in the _collapse description_.

**Notice that**: In Decoherence theory **there isn't** the concept of **measuring an operator**.

# (Apparatus) Basis Ambiguity
In the _collapse description_, when you perform a measure, you are _measuring an Operator_ acting on the Hilbert space of the apparatus.
But **you don't know how to write this Operator!!!**

You know, of course, where you are looking and how you built the apparatus but, as "how measure works" is _obscure_ in the _collapse description_ it is so the measured Operator.

## The Ambiguity
Consider there are 2 basis of the apparatus Hilbert space such that, if you write the state of the System + Apparatus adopting each of those basis, you have entanglement in both.

Now, depending on which of the two basis is a basis of **eigenstates** of the (unknown) measured operator, then you can make **DIFFERENT conclusions** on the state of the System after you perform the measure on the Apparatus!

The fact that you do not know how to write the measured operator, makes this fact a problem (an ambiguity), because if you do not know what basis, among the two, is the eigenvectors basis, then you cannot extract any information on the System's state from the results of the measure (eigenvalues).

**Notice that:** The "basis ambiguity" is only a problem of the _collapse description_, because in the _decoherence thery_ there is no concept of "measuring an operator"!

### Property that the (unknown) Measured operator must satisfy
