# Impossibility of experimentally measuring an operator of the form $A\otimes B$
## Making a long story short
If you have an eigenstate $\ket{\Psi}$ of $A\otimes B$, it is not necessarly written as product of eigenstates of $A$ and $B$, because of degeneracy.

As a consequence, if you measure before $A\otimes 1$ (getting value $a$) and _then_ $1\otimes B$ (getting value $b$), it is not granted that you get always the same results ($a*b$) starting from $\ket{\Psi}$, because there is a collapse of the state when you perform the first measure.
**Notice that**: this happens even though $A\otimes 1$ and $B \otimes B$ commute! (they commute for every $A$ and $B$).

Instead, if you measure the operator $A\otimes B$ on _its_ eigenstate $\ket{\Psi}$, you get always the same result.

**But** _experimentally_ there is no way of performing a measure of $A\otimes B$ that is different from measuring before $A$ on one particle _and then_ $B$ on the other particle. 

So it is **impossible** to **experimentally measure** the operator $A \otimes B$ on one of its eigenstates.
## Measuring $\braket{A\otimes B}$
Even though you cannot experimentally measure $A\otimes B$, you can experimentally measure $\braket{A\otimes B}$ on any state!

e.g.: In showing experimentally that Bell's inequality is wrong, you use this fact (that you can experimentally measure $\braket{A\otimes B}$).
