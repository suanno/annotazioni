I'm interested in the location of your house because is in the city center and not too far from the university.

Yes, I have a few questions i wrote on a paper.
- The first one is: can you tell me briefly about the life in your house? What is the routine of the guys who live with you?
Are there any rules about when you can leave or come back home?
At dinner we eat togheter or each or in different moments?
[What are the rules to follow?]
- My grants are italian, but I can pay all months in advace, could it be ok for you?
- Can I see more about the hose, for example can we schedule a videocall where you show me the house?

Ok, now do you want to ask me something?



Hi Elizabeth,
I want to ask you 2 questions if you don't mind.
1) I don't understand if the contract you sent me is valid from the second month or from the first. 
Because on the contract I read the starting date is "January 1", but I thought that the contract for the first month should be signed on studapart.
Can you briefly explain this?

2) I plan to move to Lyon in February and my stage ends on September 11.
So, if for you is not a problem, can I ask if we can meet in the middle and begin the contract from half of January (e.g. Monday 15)?
In any case, I want to be in Lyon the first day of the contract and January 1 is in the middle of the "end of the year holidays", so for me is difficult to move that day. Even starting the contract just one week later would be good for me.

Have a good day.
