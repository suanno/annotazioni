# Why fugacity $z=e^{\beta\mu}\rightarrow 1$ for Bosons at $T=0K$?

Even if $\beta\rightarrow\infty$ if $T\rightarrow 0$ and $\mu\geq 0$ for a gas of bosons, the **chemical potential is not a constant**!
So the fugacity $z\rightarrow 1$ and NOT to $\infty$.

This can be explained by considering the bose-einstein distribution

$$f_{\epsilon} = [e^{\beta(\epsilon-\mu)}-1]^{-1}$$

This has to diverge at $\epsilon = 0$ when $T\rightarrow 0$, because the Bose-Einsein condensation is an experimentally seen phenomena.
So

$$e^{-\beta\mu}\rightarrow 1\qquad if\qquad T\rightarrow 0$$
