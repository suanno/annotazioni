# About Golden rule and scattering probabilities
### Main problems with the rules
- The rule is valid for time $t$ **both** not too short and not too long.
You need to find the range $[t_{min}, t_{max}]$ where the rule holds.

- You have to threat _separately_ the case where the final (possible) states are
    - continuos (e.g. 1->2 body decay) 
    - discrete (e.g. atomic transitions where the incoming photon is included in $H_{int}$ and not considered as a part of the system)

### Here we discuss
- Proof of Golden Rule
- Speculations on when the quantum (projective) measure takes place during an experiment
- Properties of life times and cross sections descending from the rule (e.g. Methieus rule)

### Mathieus rule
We verify if, in precence of two scattering mechanism _simultaneously present_ the rule holds.
$\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2}$

But the results of the experiment **fluctaute too much** so _I did not manage_ verify the law.
