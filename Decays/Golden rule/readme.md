# About Golden rule and scattering probabilities
Here we discuss
- Proof of Golden Rule
- Properties of life times and cross sections descending from the rule (e.g. Methieus rule)

### Mathieus rule
We verify if, in precence of two scattering mechanism _simultaneously present_ the rule holds.
$\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2}$

But the results of the experiment **fluctaute too much** so _I did not manage_ verify the law.
