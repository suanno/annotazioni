# When the quantum (projective / collapsing) measurement takes place?
Here we introduce the concept of **frequent measurements**: we propose that, during an experiment, the measure procedure can be explained as a lot of projective measurements separated by a very short time interval.

If you question about the validity of this hypotesis, you face the fact that the Golden rule holds for short times, bu NOT TOO SHORT!!!
