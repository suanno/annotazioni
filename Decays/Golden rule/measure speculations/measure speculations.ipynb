Even if there is an interaction term, we consider (its an approximation that some day must be taken into account with the others) that the wave function collapses to _unperturbed_ eigenstates."

    "Let's consider for simplicity a _Phase Qubit_. In this system, if the system is in the 2nd exited state, it tunnels almost certainly and you measure (macroscopically) a voltage drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally, you see that if you illuminate the sample with light of frequency $\\omega_{02}$ or $\\omega_{12}$ (so with the energy needed to make a transition to the 2nd excited state _from one of the eigenstates_ $\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}$), you measure a voltage drop.\n",
    "So _I believe_ that the measurement _procedure_ works like this (Consider that, _in general_, the wave function is a **superposition** of of the eigenstates $\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}$):\n"

    "- The precence of the stream of photons evolves the coefficients $c_n(t)$ of the system's state, according to the Golden Rule(*).\n",
    "- The stream of photons continues to collapse the wave function (on the eigenstates) with a certain frequency $\\tilde{\\omega}$. So the _first time_ the state collapses after an average time $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\tilde{\\omega}}$.\n",
    "- There is a (small) probability that the wave function collapses into the state $\\ket{2}$, and so that you measure a voltage drop. You calculate it with the Golden rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*)In order to use the Golden rule, you need that the _frequency of collapse_ $\\tilde{\\omega}$ must be very high, in order that you can say that $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\tilde{\\omega}}$ is a **small time** and so you can approximate the Dyson expansion at order 1 (and so obtain the Golden rule).\n",

    "### Second speculation\n",
    "- The precence of the stream of photons evolves the coefficients $c_n(t)$ of the system's state, according to the Golden Rule.\n",
    "- The stream of photons continues **to try to collapse** the wave function on $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ **and then immediately** make the system absorb a photon to make a transition to $\\ket{2}$.\n",
    "So the system **can collapse only on** $\\ket{0}$ if the photons have frequency $\\omega_{02}$, or only on $\\ket{1}$ if they have frequency $\\omega_{12}$.\n",
    "- The **trials of collapse** happen with a **frequency** (not of collapses, **but** trials of) $\\tilde{\\omega}$ and, at each trial, the probability of collapse are $|c_0(t)|^2$ and $|c_1(t)|^2$, that you calculate with the Golden rule(*).\n",
    "\n",
    "(*)In order to use the Golden rule, you need that the _frequency of collapse_ $\\tilde{\\omega}$ must be very high (this time even more), in order that you can collapse in a time that you can tell **small** and so you can approximate the Dyson expansion at order 1 (and so obtain the Golden rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this speculation\n",
    "- If the initial state is the eigenstate $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$, then the system won't **never** absorb photons _of the different kind_. So you can measure the state simply by trying if you see a voltage drop with one frequency and, if it is not so, you switch frequency and you will see it.\n",
    "If the initial state is an eigenstate, I think there's no need of talking of wave function collapse on an eigenstate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the initial state is a _linear combination_ of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, then in the low times approximation you have that\n",
    "$$|c_i(t)|^2 = |c_i(0)|^2 + o(t)\\quad\\text{for i = 0, 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so, if the state **is very close to $\\ket{1}$**, then there is a very small (but non-zero) probability that, illuminating the sample with the phonons' frequency $\\omega_{02}$ you see a voltage drop.\n",
    "But this probability is very low, respecting to the one of measuring a voltage drop with photons' frequency $\\omega_{02}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can _take advantage_ of this fact by **switching sufficiently fast** between the two photons' frequencies.\n",
    "This switch must be very frequent, because the probability of measuring a voltage drop, when illuminating the sample with the **wrong** photons' frequency $\\omega_{02}$ for a time t is:\n",
    "$$t\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{2\\pi}|c_0(0)|^2$$\n",
    "because the idea is that, at each period of the _collapse trials_ you flip a coin with success' probability |c_0(0)|^2, and the experiment holds a time $t$ (that must be small, in order for the Golden rule to hold).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- You can tell if the state is very close to $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "And appreciate that you need just this for quantum computing applications, because at the end of the experiment the qubit will be _theoretically_ only in one of the two eigenstates (even before the measurement). And then, practically, it will be in a superposition, but that is very close to one of the two eigenstates."
